Title: Criteria's for database evanluation


The following criteria's will help us, to evaluate the Database System, which
we can use:

- Scaleable (the database must work, with a lot's of data's in a short time and
  can be bigger and bigger)
- Data safety
  - Data loss (if the Database will crash, what happens with the data in the
    database, which are already provided to it)
- Performance (efficiency)
  -with the same ressources of hardware get the best result
  -with the same ressources of hardware get the fastest result
- Information about the Database (knowlage and documentation)
  - is it easy to learn, that an employee of a company can learn the database
  fast
  -are there informationens, which can find in the internet or something else
